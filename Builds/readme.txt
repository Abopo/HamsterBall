Thank you for trying out Hamster Ball! 

OVERVIEW

Hamster Ball is a new take on classic arcade vs puzzle games. Think of it as a fusion
of Puzzle Bobble and the original Mario Bros. The level is made up of 2 halves: The top
half is a matching-puzzle game board, while the bottom half is a simple platformer area.

You play as Bub from Puzzle Bobble because I'm not an artist. As you play, various 
colored hamsters will spawn from the top of the level and walk about the are from top 
to bottom. Your goal is to catch these hamsters in bubbles, and throw them to the top 
of the level to make matches of 3 or more.

Up to 4 players can play at a time, on teams of 2 (also possible to play 1v2). 

MECHANICS

Bub can walk and jump around with standard platformer controls. Bub has a Bubble attack
that catches hamsters in bubbles. Once a hamster is caught, he can press the Bubble
button again to Ready his throw. While Readying, bub will halt in place (even in midair)
and can aim his throw to the left/right. Once his shot is lined up, he can press the
Bubble button once more to throw the hamster to the board.

On the far left and right of the screen is each teams Hamster Meter. These meters will 
fill whenever an opposing player makes a match. When the bar fills up, a line is added 
to the top of the teams puzzle board.
In the Character Select screen, you will see the Hamster Meters for each team. Here they
can be adjusted for balance reasons or to change the pace of the game. The lower you set
a teams Hamster Meter, the quicker lines will be added. You can set both teams to lower
handicaps to have a faster paced game, or do a 1v2 game and set the 2 player team to a 
low handicap to make it more fair.

If a collection of bubbles is separated from the board (through a match), those bubbles
will fall off the board. Every bubble dropped adds to the opponents Hamster Meter.

To make things even more interesting there is a brand new mechanic to shake things up.
Once enough time has passed, you will be able to Swap to your opponents field and
interact with anything on their side as you could on yours. This allows you to do things
such as: steal a colored hamster you need and bring it back to your side, throw a wrong
colored hamster at a matching set to mess up their strategy, etc.
Players also have a punch button that allows them to fight each other once two or more 
players are on the same field. Punching another player will knock them back and stun them
for a short time. They will also drop any hamster they happen to be holding at the time!
So make sure to defend your turf when your opponent shifts over and tries to disrupt your field.


HAMSTERS

Most hamsters are a simple color: Green, Red, Orange, Gray, Blue, and Pink. However,
there are a few special Hamster types that will spawn more rarely. These are the Rainbow,
Dead, and Gravity Hamsters.
-The Rainbow hamster will match with all colors, and can even match with multiple colors
at once. The Rainbow hamster also walks faster than other hamsters, so catch it quick!
-The Dead hamster won't match with any color, and will increase the handicap bar by 5
instead of 1 when it walks off the bottom of the level. It also walks slower than other
hamsters, so you have time to decide what to do with it. (It's a great hamster to put
on opponents boards!)
-The Gravity hamster is complicated. It acts as an anchor point for bubbles on the board.
This means that even when a bundle of bubbles are separated from the board, if they are
connected to a Gravity hamster, they won't fall! The bundle will fall if the Gravity
hamster is matched. It is difficult to use properly, but can set up massive drops if set
up intelligently.
