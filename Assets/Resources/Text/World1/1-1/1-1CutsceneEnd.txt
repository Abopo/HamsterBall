I don't know, I didn't recognize his uniform. But I bet Owl will know, he keeps tabs on everything that happens in the Forest.

We're so sorry Overseer, the hamsters getting captured was all our fault, we didn't think anything was going to happen.

It's ok you two, what's done is done. However, it's now up to you two to head out and rescue the remaining hamsters.
D
I'm not as young as I used to be, and I have to stay behind to look after any hamsters that return after you rescue them.

I'm not sure. I doubt he'll be at his home with all of this happening...

Look you guys, I can see more hamsters in the direction that guy ran!

I bet if we follow the trail of hamsters, we'll eventually find Owl.
