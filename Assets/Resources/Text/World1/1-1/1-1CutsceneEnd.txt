Shoot, nobody said anything about these kids!

Lackey - Worried

The boss is gonna kill me...

D
Just who was that guy?

C2
Overseer
D
I don't know, I didn't recognize his uniform. But I bet Owl will know, he keeps tabs on everything that happens in the Forest.

We're so sorry Overseer, the hamsters getting captured was all our fault, we didn't think anything was going to happen.

C2
Overseer
D
It's ok you two, what's done is done. However, it's now up to you two to head out and rescue the remaining hamsters.
D
I'm not as young as I used to be, and I have to stay behind to look after any hamsters that return after you rescue them.

C1
Girl
D
It was our fault, so we will take responsibility.

C1
Boy - Determined
D
Yeah! You can count on us! We'll save every last hamster!

First we should find Owl. Where do you think he is?

C2
Overseer
D
I'm not sure. I doubt he'll be at his home with all of this happening...

C1
Boy
D
Look you guys, I can see more hamsters in the direction that guy ran!
D
I bet if we follow the trail of hamsters, we'll eventually find Owl.

Good work bro! Let's go!

C2
Overseer

Be careful you two!
