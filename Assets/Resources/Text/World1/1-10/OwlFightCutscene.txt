We are thanks to you. Where have you been?

C2
Owl - Annoyed

I’ve been flying all over the Forest trying to get rid of these damn Lackeys.

C1
Boy - Neutral
D
We’ve been doing the same thing! They captured all the hamsters from camp and are taking them somewhere.

C1

We were hoping you knew where so we could go rescue them.

C2
Owl - Neutral
D
These are Villains Lackeys! He’s a shrewd businessman from the City.

If the Lackeys are taking the hamsters anywhere, it’s there.

All the way to the City?! How are we supposed to get there?

C2
Owl - Thinking
D
Hmmm I know a way, but it’ll be dangerous. I don’t know if you kids are ready…

C1
Girl - Determined
D
We have to try, it’s the only way to save the hamsters!

C1
Boy - Sad
D
Yeah… it’s our fault they were taken. So we have to do everything we can to save them!

C2
Owl - Neutral
D
Alright then, prove to me you are strong enough to make it.
D
If you can beat me in a match I’ll tell you how to get to the City.
