That's up to you! You can do everything you normally can over there.
D
You can thow hamsters at their board, steal their hamsters for yourself,

you can even attack your opponent with the B button!

D
It is! But don't dawdle, you only have a limited time over there.
D
And your opponent can attack you too to prevent you from doing what you want.

If you need to come back sooner, hit the Y button again to return immediately.
