Not bad kid! Matching is a great way to attack your opponent but it's not the only way!
D
If your match separates any hamsters from the group, they'll drop from the board.
D
Every hamster dropped this way fills up your opponent's meter by 3!

You can also get bonuses for doing certain actions.

Such as bouncing shots off the wall or making multiple matches in a row.

Experiment and see what you can find!

When that bar is full, you are able to do something very special.

Go ahead and hit the N key and see what happens.
