Great throw kid! Now I'll explain matching.
D
If you connect 3 or more of the same color hamsters they'll match, clear from your board and fill up your opponent's meter.
D
When that meter fills up, a whole line of hamsters will get added to their board, pushing everything down one line.
D
If a hamster reaches too low, they'll lose!
D
Bigger matches will fill up the meter more, so try to aim for big matches!
D
Go ahead and try to make a couple matches.
