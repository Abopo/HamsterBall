Good work, next I'll teach you about the hamsters.
D
The hamsters will come out of those pipes you see on the side of the screen. They'll run back and forth, moving down the area.
D
When they reach the bottom of the screen, they'll reenter the pipe and loop around.
D
You can use the <c=4356FF>X<c=white> button to catch hamsters in a ball, go ahead and try to catch one of the hamsters now.
