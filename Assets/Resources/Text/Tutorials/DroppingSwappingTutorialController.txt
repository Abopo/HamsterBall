Not bad kid! Matching is a great way to attack your opponent but it's not the only way!

If your match separates any hamsters from the group, they'll drop from the board.
D
Every hamster dropped this way fills up your opponent's meter by 2!

When that bar is full, you are able to do something very special.

Go ahead and hit the Y button and see what happens.
